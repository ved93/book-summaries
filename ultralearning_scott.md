### Intro
This book is about how to learn faster. It lays out techniques author had used in MIT challenge. 


### Chapter 1: Can you get an MIT education without going to MIT 
In this chapter, author talks about the MIT challenge. It was wonderful to read about the stories of ultralearners. Benny Lewis's language challenge., Roger Craig's trivia mastery about how gamed the knowledge competition, and Erica Baron's game development odyssey. 

### Chapter 2: Why ultralearning matters?
Scott talked about technology, economics and tuition fee for making a case for ultralearning. Also talked about talent and accelerating careers with ultra-learning.

### Chapter 3: How to become the ultralearner
In this chapter, scott talks about amazing feat achieved by de Montebello. De Montebello was a musician then his ultralearning project was to be good at public speaking then public speaking became his career.
Principles of ultralearning, he touched upon.

### Principle 1: Metalearning
In this chapter, Scott talks about how metalearning helps in acquiring knowledge. Basically it says that you must have map. He give an example of Everett who demonstate learning a completely new language within 30 minutes. Metalearning is learning about learning.   
So how to draw the map:
Determine Why, What and How!
Why: why do you want to learn something
What: refers to knowledge and abilities you will need to acquire in order to be successful
How: refers to methods , environments and resources you will need.

**Why**
The expert interview method. 
**What**
Concepts, Facts and Procedure
**How**
Benchmarking:Like scott did with MIT
The emphasize/Exclude method 
10% planning rule
Law of diminishing return

### Principle 2: Focus
Author talks about how focus is necessary and how can you have the focus. He talks about the three problems in focus:  
1. Procastination: Pomodoro techniques and 5 minute rule are the solution
2. Failing to sustain focus(Getting distracted): Scott talks about Flow and deliberate practice and highlight the problem with flow state. There are three sources that causes focus to break dkwn :
   - Your environment
   - Your task: certain activities, due to their nature, are harder to focus than others. i.e. watching MIT videos are easier than to solve the problems
   - Mind: should be calm and tension free  
3. Failing to create teh write kiond of focus: There is an interesting reaserch about arousal vs task complexity. Activities like games require high arousal. High arousal creates high alertness. Athlete rquire this kind of concentration to shoot a basketball propertly, where the task is fairly simple but requires concentration to execute properly.More complext task such as solving math problemor writing essays require a relaxed kimd of focus.
Now that we have discussed how to get started on learning hard things, lets move to discussing the right way to learn them. The next principle, directness,  is first to explain what types of things you shpould do while learning and more important which you should avoid if you want to use what you learn. 

### Principle 3: Directness
Scott talks about Vatsal Jaiswal example. How he got the job he wanted during the recession time. You need to be direct while you are learning. 
The reason he faced difficulty in getting a job was because tehtre is difference in what you learn and how you apply them in real life.
The easiest way to learn directly is to simply spend a lot of time doing the things you want to become good at. If you want to learn a language , speak it , as Benny Lewis does. If you want to master making video games, then make them.
Transfer concept: You leanr in one context say in class room and apply in new context say in real luife. 
How ultra learners avoid the problem of transfer and learn directly.
1. Project based learning:
2. Immersive learning: is the process of surrounding yourself wuith the target enviornment in which skill is practiced. i.e. learning language example where that language is spoken
3. The overkill approach: is to increase the challenge, so that the skill level required is wholly contained within the goal that is set.

How this is enough to get you started on learning directly but in order to master skills quickly, thjis isn't enough and thats where next princilple comes in. 

### Principle 4: Drill(Attack your weakest point)
Scott gives Benjamin franklin example.
In order to improve performance in one aspect, you may need to devote so much attention to taht one aspect that the other parts of performance may start to go down. When Franklin focused on reconstructing the order of an essay rather than also needing to worry about word usage, grammer and the content of teh arguments.
The direct-thyen-drill approach
Tactics for designing drills: 
1. Time Slicing : isolate the part which needs improvement.Like athlete practicing penalty shots more. 
2. Cognitive component: Author's mandarine example
3. The copycat: copy the parts which you dont need to drill
4. The magnifying glass method:
5. Pre-requisite chaining: Go back and forth with the foundation topics


### Principle 5: Retrieval(Test to learn)
