### Intro
This book is about how to learn faster. It lays out techniques author had used in MIT challenge. 


### Chapter 1: Can you get an MIT education without going to MIT 
In this chapter, author talks about the MIT challenge. It was wonderful to read about the stories of ultralearners. Benny Lewis's language challenge., Roger Craig's trivia mastery about how gamed the knowledge competition, and Erica Baron's game development odyssey. 

### Chapter 2: Why ultralearning matters?
Scott talked about technology, economics and tuition fee for making a case for ultralearning. Also talked about talent and accelerating careers with ultra-learning.

### Chapter 3: How to become the ultralearner
In this chapter, scott talks about amazing feat achieved by de Montebello. De Montebello was a musician then his ultralearning project was to be good at public speaking then public speaking became his career.
Principles of ultralearning, he touched upon.

### Principle 1: Metalearning
In this chapter, Scott talks about how metalearning helps in acquiring knowledge.Basically it says that you must have map. He give an example of Everett who demonstate learning a completely new language within 30 minutes. Metalearning is learning about learning.   
So how to draw the map:
Determine Why, What and How!
Why: why do you want to learn something
What: refers to knowledge and abilities you will need to acquire in order to be successful
How: refers to methods , environments and resources you will need.

**Why**
The expert interview method. 
**What**
Concepts, Facts and Procedure
**How**
Benchmarking:Like scott did with MIT
The emphasize/Exclude method 
10% planning rule
Law of diminishing return

### Principle 2: Focus
Author talks about how focus is necessary and how can you have the focus. He talks about the three problems in focus:  
1. Procastination: Pomodoro techniques and 5 minute rule are the solution
2. Failing to sustain focus(Getting distracted): Scott talks about Flow and deliberate practice and highlight the problem with flow state. There are three sources that causes focus to break dkwn :
   - Your environment
   - Your task: certain activities, due to their nature, are harder to focus than others. i.e. watching MIT videos are easier than to solve the problems
   - Mind: should be calm and tension free  
3. Failing to create teh write kiond of focus: There is an interesting reaserch about arousal vs task complexity. Activities like games require high arousal. High arousal creates high alertness. Athlete rquire this kind of concentration to shoot a basketball propertly, where the task is fairly simple but requires concentration to execute properly.More complext task such as solving math problemor writing essays require a relaxed kimd of focus.

### Principle 3: Directness
