## 1. No one's crazy
Here author gave perspective about how different people are shaped to see the money matter in different contexts.


## 2. Luck and Risks
I liked this chapter. One highlight is nothing as good or as bad as it seems. Here Morgan gave Gates example how he ended up being so successful and how his friend Kevin attributed to risk. Both had one in a million chance. The amount of role luck or risk plays in your life is not quantifiable. You just need to be understanding of luck and risk whenver you analyse someone's success or failure.
