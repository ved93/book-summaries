### Intro
Its about finding the voice. Mindfulness is important.If there is one thing to take from this book then take this : commit five minutes of your day, each day, ideally in the morning, to your voice. This will set your voice up for the day. This book is about what you do. Consitency beats intensity every time. Consitency of five minutes a day can change your voice faster than you realise.


### Chapter 1: Your incredible instrument
Surprising secret to speaking with confidence is  BREATHING.  
Find your vocal folds: say 'aaaaaa', 'eeeeee','meeee' etc. and realise its resonance in the body. 
Try this: feel the reflex. page no-34
Inhale--Belly out
Exhale--Belly in   
*Diaphragm is the king*   
Try this : jellyfish breathing -page 38
Try this : Weigh your diaphragm. page no-44

You can explore the diaphragm breathing sitting up. Place a hand on your stomach to feel the movement of breath.If you allow your back to rest on the back of chair you can feel your back ribs open and push into the back of the chair as breath comes in. Practice this regularly and you will start to find you can draw on the power of diaphragm to support you whenever you iopen your mouth to speak. The full, relaxed power of your voice will start to reveal itself, your confidence will blossom too.
Try this : Open up your resonance, 48
Power of yawn etc. Try other excerices she mentioned in the book.

### Chapter 2: Find your calm centre
This chapter is also about breath and how to calm yourself. This chapeter will introduce vagus tone and take a half concept. Avoid digital devices before an important meeting or speaking engagement.
Digital devices have an effect on your nervous system, in turn affecting your voice and we know your voice is breath. 
Never hold your breath. 
Try this: Are you holding your breath? page 73
Pick up your phone and read few messages and observe your breathing. Realise your breath is high in chest or not. Then calm it down. Vreath in slowly. Make this a habit. Notice your breathing whenever you stare at screens. Awareness is the first step towards taking control of your system.

*How to find your friend system*
1. Deliberately breathing a feeling of relief can be a quick way into calm when you need it. Actors are taught to identify and draw on the breathing
you have when you feel a sense of relief- that low , wide, easy breath that opens up the torso. Tune into the last time you felt a sense of relief, perhaps after an interview, or at the end of a working day, and breath it now.
2. Imagine that you are taling to a old friend. Recently zoom meeting with movie group felt so confortable. Even saying I am excited to be here cna allow you to feel connected and in the control.
3. Just try to feel special. Think about you have come a long way. You have been doing great. Be proud of yourself.

Try this: Cut the gasp. Page 88
The simplest  way to cut the gasp is to close your mouth when you pause for breath. It requires you to put a break between sentences, and gives you space to take the natural pause for breath that you have when chatting with friends.This also gives you time to notice how your words are landing (This is happening with most of the time. Dont gasp now.)   
Practice this excercise daily so its in the muscles.   
1. Think of walking in the garden of roses and letting the smell of roses arrive in the nostrils. Notice how you bretah in that lovely smell; wide , expensive and easy. It opens up your sinuses, body and your breath withnout effort.  
Practice this wherever you go. Notice how you can pause- and imperceptibly smell a rose- everytime you speak. 

**Vagus Tone**   
Its great for helping you find you voice under pressure.   
How to improve it?   
1. Breath in for 4 through your nose. 
2. Hold breath gently for up to 7 counts.
3. Breath out slowly, for 8 , through the mouth. You can also try humm sound while breathing out.
4. Repeat it for 2 minutes.

**Take a half**
How do you unplug before the moments that matter. Take a half. the half is the 35 minutes of focused energy before th show starts. This is mindfulness excercise.  


**Summary**
1. There is no such thing as a naturally confident speaker. There are only people who have learned how to find calm and safety under pressure by stewarding their system from *foe* to *friend*
2. To find your calm centre quickly you need to make your system feel safe. Taking time before you have to speak or perform can really help your body, mind and voice to do that. 
3. We think of speaking as something that makes us nervous. But actually, when we knowhow to speak without gasping or rushing, and to enjoy the pauses, we can calm ourselves down as we speak.
4. Go through all the questions in the chapter. Its really good.
