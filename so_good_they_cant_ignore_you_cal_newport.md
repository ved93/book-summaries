Intro:
In this book, Cal makes a case for why follow your passion is bad advice. My idea was to read this book to understand how to be good at what you do and how people end up loving what they do. I have lot of doubts about myself I hope to clear them throught this book. 


### Rule 1-Dont follow your passion
Newport explores this and talk about steve jobs that he gave the advice which he didn't apply to himself. he also gives examples about that passion is rare amd sometimes passion is dangerous.



### Rule 2: Be so good they cant ignore you
Newport says there are two mindset-- passion focused and craftman's focused. He makes a perfect case for why craftman's mindset triumph. Chapter 5 is about the importance of craftman's mindset. He says traits that make a great job are rare so if you want a great job then you need to build rare skills for it.
He also talks about disquialier for craftsman mindset. 
Chaper 6 is about career capitalists. He gives example of Alex berger how he broke into hollywood and gives another example of cleantech VC.  
Chapter 7 is about becoming a craftman. He gives examples about how people become grandmasters and present a study as well. People who had focus on deliberate skill were the ones who did not stuck at inetermediate levels.
Rule 2 summary:
It was the first to tackle what you should do if following passion is bad advice?
You need to acquire career capital(rare and valuable skills) and noted that foundation of constructing work you love is acquiring the large store of this capital. So adopt craftman mindset and practice deliberate practice. 
Five habits of craftsman: 
1. Decide what capital market you are in
2. Identify your capital type 
3. Define good
4. Stretch and destroy 
5. Be patient



### Rule 3: Turn down a promotion
Chapter 8 was about control. Cal tells the story of a graduate Ryan who became farmer. He realised its the control which people fancy about them. So if your goal is to love what you do, first step is to acquire career capital. Next step is to invest this capital in the traits that defines great work. Control is one of the most important target you can choose for this investment. 
Chapter 9 was about first control trap. Author says its dangerous to pursue control if you dont have enough career capital. He gives the example of Jane. She wanted to pursue more control in life. She wanted to pursue adventures. So she dropped out of her college. After some time her plan fell apart. Then He gave an example of blogger as well.
Chapter 10 was about second control trap.Here he tells the story of Lulu(QA) and Lewis(Doctor). Lulu generated capital and then asked for more control. She turned down the promotion as well. And Lewis took a 2 year break from residency. They were able to control their time because they had enough career capital to back up.
