Intro: This is the book on writing. William Zinsser says that writng principles hasnt changed much in last 30 years of book and they are not going to change also. So writing is always about rewriting. 

## Part 1: Principles

### Chapter 1: The transaction

“Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is. I often find myself reading with interest about a topic I never thought would interest me—some scientific quest, perhaps. What holds me is the enthusiasm of the writer for his field. How was he drawn into it? What emotional baggage did he bring along? How did it change his life?”
“This is the personal transaction that’s at the heart of good nonfiction writing. Out of it come two of the most important qualities that this book will go in search of: humanity and warmth.”

### Chapter 2: Simplicity

“The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.”
“Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can’t exist without the other.”
“It won’t do to say that the reader is too dumb or too lazy to keep pace with the train of thought. If the reader is lost, it’s usually because the writer hasn’t been careful enough.”
Constantly ask yourself: “What am I trying to say?” Then look at what you have written and ask if you have said it.
“Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time. Remember this in moments of despair. If you find that writing is hard, it’s because it is hard.”

Try to avoid all words that end in “-ly”. Avoid words like “experiencing”.
If you might add, add it. If it should be pointed out, point it out. If it is interesting to note, make it interesting; are we not all stupefied by what follows when someone says, "This will interest you"?
Simplify, simplify.

### Chapter 3: Clutter
Look for the clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly. Be grateful for everything you can throw away. Reexamine each sentence you put on paper. Is every word doing new work? Can any thought be expressed with more economy? Is anything pompous or pretentious or faddish? Are you hanging on to something useless just because you think it’s beautiful?”
Simplify, simplify.
Example: “At this point of time” vs. “now.”
Unnecessary prepositions: “Head up committees” vs. “head committees.”
Unnecessary adjectives: “A personal friend of mine” vs. “a friend of mine.”
Verbose substitutes: “currently” and “at the present time” vs. “now.”
Weak verb substitutes: “Are you experiencing any pain?” vs. “Does it hurt?”
Ponderous euphemism (sometimes politically correct language): “Minimally exceptional” vs. “ordinary.”
Corporate-speak: “Impacted with the ground prematurely” vs. “crashed.”
“Beware, then, of the long word that’s no better than the short word: “assistance” (help), “numerous” (many), “facilitate” (ease), “individual” (man or woman), “remainder” (ret), “initial” (first), “implement” (do), “sufficient” (enough), “attempt” (try), “referred to as” (called) and hundreds more.”
“Beware all of the slippery new fad words: paradigm and parameter, prioritize and potentialize…Don’t dialogue with someone you can talk too. Don’t interface with anybody.”
Word clusters to introduce explanations: “I might add,” “it should be pointed out,” “it is interesting to note.”
Word clusters that inflate simpler alternatives: “With the possible exception of” (except), “due to the fact that” (because), “he totally lacked the ability to” (he couldn’t), “until such time as” (until), “for the purpose of” (for).
Redundant adverbs: “smile happily.”
Redundant adjective: “tall skyscraper.”  
Weak qualifiers: “a bit,” “sort of,” “in a sense.”  

Is there any way to recognize clutter at a glance? Here’s a device my students at Yale found helpful. I would put brackets around every component in a piece of writing that wasn’t doing useful work. Often just one word got bracketed: the unnecessary preposition appended to a verb (“order up”), or the adverb that carries the same meaning as the verb (“smile happily”), or the adjective that states a known fact (“tall skyscraper”). Often my brackets surrounded the little qualifiers that weaken any sentence they inhabit (“a bit,” “sort of), or phrases like “in a sense,” which don’t mean anything. Sometimes my brackets surrounded an entire sentence—the one that essentially repeats what the previous sentence said, or that says something readers don’t need to know or can figure out for themselves. Most first drafts can be cut by 50 percent without losing any information or losing the author’s voice.


### Chapter 4: Style

“You have to strip your writing down before you can build it back up. You must know what the essential tools are and what job they were designed to do. Extending the metaphor of carpentry, it’s first necessary to be able to saw wood neatly and to drive nails. Later you can bevel the edges or add elegant finials, if that’s your taste. But you can forget that you are practicing a craft that’s based on certain principles.If the nails are weak, your house will collapse. If your verbs are weak and your syntax is rickety, your sentences will fall apart.”  
Zinsser’s pushback against complaints about “eliminating everything” is that you must first master the basics. Once basics are under control, you can introduce stylistic elements if necessary.
“First, then, learn to hammer the nails, and if what you build is sturdy and serviceable, take satisfaction in its plain strength.”
“You will be impatient to find a ‘style’—to embellish the plain words so that readers will recognize you as someone special.”
“The reader will notice if you are putting on airs. Readers want the person who is talking to them to sound genuine.”
“It’s amazing how often an editor can throw away the first three or four paragraphs of an article, or even the first few pages, and start with the paragraph where the writer begins to sound like himself…”
“Writers are obviously at their most natural when they write in the first person. Writing is an intimate transaction between two people...therefore I urge people to write in the first person…”
“Good writers are visible just behind their words. If you aren’t allowed to use ‘I,’ at least think ‘I’ while you write…”

### Chapter 5: The Audience

“Soon after you confront the matter of preserving your identity, another question will occur to you: ‘Who am I writing for?’…You are writing for yourself. Don’t try to visualize the great mass audience.”
In case Zinsser’s advice above seem contradictory to earlier statements about not boring your reader, Zinsser justifies his point. Not boring your reader is about craft. Writing for yourself is a matter of attitude and using your skill to express your personality.
“Never say anything in writing that you wouldn’t comfortably say in conversation.”
“Menken was never timid or evasive; he didn’t kowtow to the reader or curry anyone’s favor. It takes courage to be such a writer, but it is out of such courage that revered and influential journalists are born.”

### Chapter 6: Words

“There is a kind of writing that might be called journalese, and it’s the death of freshness in anybody’s style…a mixture of cheap words, made-up words and clichés that have become so pervasive…”
Example: Adjectives used as nouns like “greats” and “notables.”
Nouns used as verbs: “to host.”
Nouns chopped off to form verbs: “enthuse”, “emote.”
Nouns padded to form verbs: “beef up,” “put teeth into.”
“Dreary phrases constitute writing at its most banal. We know just what to expect. No surprise awaits us in the form of an unusual word, an oblique look. We are in the hands of a hack, and we know it right away. We stop reading.”
“Notice the decisions that other writers making in their choice of words and be finicky about the ones you select from the vast supply. The race in writing is not to the swift but to the original.”
“Writing is learned by imitation…I learned by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it.”
“Get in the habit of using dictionaries.”
Zinsser recommends reading E.B. White’s “The Elements of Style” once a year.
“If all your sentences move at the same plodding gait, which even you recognize as deadly but don’t know how to cure, read them aloud.”

Notice the decisions that other writers make in their choice of words and be finicky about the ones you select from the vast supply. The race in writing is not to the swift but to the original.

The Thesaurus is to the writer what a rhyming dictionary is to the songwriter—a reminder of all the choices.

Also bear in mind, when you’re choosing words and stringing them together, how they sound. This may seem absurd: readers read with their eyes. But in fact they hear what they are reading far more than you realize. Therefore such matters as rhythm and alliteration are vital to every sentence. Good writers of prose must be part poet, always listening to what they write.

If all your sentences move at the same plodding gait, which even you recognize as deadly but don’t know how to cure, read them aloud. (I write entirely by ear and read everything aloud before letting it go out into the world.) You’ll begin to hear where the trouble lies. See if you can gain variety by reversing the order of a sentence, or by substituting a word that has freshness or oddity, or by altering the length of your sentences so they don’t all sound as if they came out of the same mold. An occasional short sentence can carry a tremendous punch. It stays in the reader’s ear. Remember that words are the only tools you’ve got. Learn to use them with originality and care. And also remember: somebody out there is listening.

Use a dictionary, and use a dictionary of synonyms. Avoid journalese.

### Chapter 7: Usage

“The laws of usage are relative, bending with the taste of the lawmaker.”
“The spoken language is looser than the written language.”
“One helpful approach is to try to separate usage from jargon.”
“Good usage, to me, consists of using good words if they already exist—as they almost always do—to express myself clearly and simply to someone else.”

## Part 2: Methods

### Chapter 8: Unity
“The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number of words on a regular basis.”
“All writing is ultimately a question of solving a problem. It may be a problem of where to obtain the facts or how to organize the material. It may be a problem of approach or attitude, tone or style.”
“Unity is the anchor of good writing. So, first get your unities straight…therefore choose from among the many variables and stick to your choice.”
“One choice is unity of pronoun. Are you going to write in the first person, as a participant, or in the third person, as an observer?”
“Unity of tense is another choice. Most people write mainly in the past tense, but some people write agreeable in the present. What is not agreeable is to switch back and forth…you must choose the tense in which you are principally going to address the reader, no matter how many glances you may take backward or forward along the way.”
“Another choice is unity of mood.” Casual? Formal? Serious?
“What one point do I want to make?…Every writing project must be reduced before you start to write.”
“Every piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn’t have before. Not two thoughts, or five—just one.”
“Trust your material if it’s taking you into terrain you didn’t intend to enter but where the vibrations are good. Adjust your style accordingly and proceed to whatever destination you reach. Don’t become the prisoner of a preconceived plan. Writing is no respecter of blueprints.”

How much do I want to cover? What one point do I want to make?
Every writing project must be reduced before you start to write.
Therefore think small. Decide what corner of your subject you’re going to bite off, and be content to cover it well and stop.

### Chapter 9: The Lead and the Ending

“The most important sentence in any article is the first one. If it doesn’t induce the reader to proceed to the second sentence, your article is dead. And if the second sentence doesn’t induce him to continue to the third sentence, it’s equally dead. Of such a progression of sentences, each tugging the reader forward until he is hooked, a writer constructs that fateful unit, the ‘lead.’”
There’s no easy answer to how long a lead should be (and it may differ by genre/subject). However the gist is always the same: capture that reader immediately.
The lead must do some real work. It must provide hard details that tell the reader why the piece was written and why he ought to read it…coax the reader a little more; keep him inquisitive.”
“Every paragraph should amplify the one that preceded it.”
“Take special care with a the last sentence of each paragraph—it’s the crucial springboard to the next paragraph.”
Example of an effective lead: “I’ve often wondered what goes into a hot dog. Now I know and I wish I didn’t. My trouble began when the Department of Agriculture published the hot dog’s ingredients…”
“You should always collect more material than you will use. Every article is strong in proportion to the surplus of details from which you can choose the few that will serve you best.”
“Look for your material everywhere, not just by reading the obvious sources and interviewing the obvious people…our daily landscape is thick with absurd messages and portents. Notice them. They not only have social significance; they are often just quirky enough to make a lead that’s different from everybody else’s.
Overused lead: The future archaeologist. E.g. “When some future archaeologist stumbles on the remains of our civilization, what will he make of the jukebox?” (Similar to the visitor from Mars lead).
Overused lead: The have-in-common lead. E.g. “What did Stalin, MacArthur, Wittgenstein and Kurosawa have in common? They all loved Westerns.”
Opening with a story is a simple but powerful solution. Don’t underestimate the power of narrative to hold someone’s attention.
“Knowing when to end an article is far more important that most writers realize. You should give as much thought to choosing your last sentence as you did to your first.”
“The perfect ending should take your readers slightly by surprise and yet seem exactly right. They didn’t expect the article to end so soon, or so abruptly, or to say what it said.”
“Surprise is the most refreshing element in nonfiction writing. If something surprises you it will also surprise—and delight—the people you are writing for.”
