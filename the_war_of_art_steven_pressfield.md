Summary: The Wars of Art shows us that if you’re looking to achieve anything, especially something creative,, you almost definitely have the skills and abilities to be able to do it. For example, if you want to be a writer, based on the fact that you’re reading this, you have the ability to read and write. But being able to write isn’t the be-all-and-end-all of actually writing a book.

“There’s a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don’t… It’s not the writing part that’s hard. What’s hard is sitting down to write.”

What keeps us from sitting down to write? The Resistance. This book is all about The Resistance, and is broken into three parts: Defining the Enemy, Combatting Resistance, The Higher Realm. For anyone who wants to pursue a creative endeavour but has never been able to actually sit down and do the work, this book serves as a great kick in the behind.
