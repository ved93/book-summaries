This is the book that I am reading and it has some valuable lessons for writing in business world

We will write in bullet points

### Chapter 1 : Writing that works

1. A discipline for writing: putting down first what you want the readers to do, next the three most imp things the reader needs to understand to take that action, then starting to write. When you are done, read yourself and ask whether if you were the reader , would you take the action on the basis of whats written.  
2. You must express your point of view persuasively. 

### Chapter 2 : Dont mumble- and other principles of effective writing
1. Make organisation of writing clear: When you write anything longer than few paragraphs, start by telling the reader where you are going.  
First, you must know where you are going yourself. Make an outline of major points, placing supporting details in their proper position. End with a summary. Summary is not a conclusion. Your summary should introduce no new ideas, it should summarize the most important points you have made.   
2. Use short paragraphs, short sentences and short words
3. Use active voice and avoid vague adjective and adverb(vergy good-> great, basically -> vitally etc)
4. Be specific and come to the point
5. Strike out the words you dont need. (ex. advance plan -> plan,take action -> act, study in depth-> study)
6. keep in your mind what your reader doesnt know.
7. Write so that you cant be misunderstood. 
8. Use plain english even on technical subjects. 
   
### Chapter 3: I love my computer!
1. Write first, format later.
2. Cautions      
   - Proof-read and proofread again
   - spell checker program
   - stick to the point

### Chapter 4: E-mail
1. Make the subject heading clear -- and compelling(i.e Status of proposal or Winning client approval )
2. Cut to the point    
   - Try to take out 50% of what you have written
   - Keep it short and sweet is the first email principle at HBO
3. Set the right tone of voice
   - the subject heading can be good place to establish tone you want

Email rules by Electronic Art CEO for its employees   
1. Dont use email when a quick word over a cube wall will do the trick 
2. Dont send unless what you are sending 
   - imparts a new information to someone who needs it. or 
   - agrees to a request. or
   - respond to a question or 
   - ask a question or makes a request

### Chapter 5: Memos and letters that get things done  
1. Make your first sentence work hard 
2. Stop when you are through
3. Be specific about next step
4. Read Churchil's memo. 

### Chapter 6: Writing for an audience- Presentation and Speeches
The principal form of presentation in most orgs has become the "deck", jargon for page after page of bulletedpoints serving as a framework for spoken elaboration.  
Reducing the issue to "its pulsing essence" is what a well done deck does best. Only key points on each page, as few words as possible. But the points on page must point to something- some *action*.

The format carries the audience on a flow of logic:  
1. Objective 
2. Background
3. Facts
4. Conclusions
5. Recommendations
6. Next steps   
A useful model to help organise that analysis is the pyramid principle.
#### The Pyramid principle
The easiest order is to receive the major, more abstract ideas before the minor, supporting ones.And since the major ideas are always derived from minor ones, the ideal structure of the ideas will be always be a pyramid of group of ideas tied together by a single overall thought.   
Within that pyramid structure, the ideas will relate vertically- in that a point at any level will always be a summary of the ideas grouped below, and horizontally--in  that the ideas will have been grouped together because they present a logical arguement.   

**How to organise presentations**  
1. Keep things simple-- Keep them on target
2. Tell your audience where you are going
3. Think headlines, not labels
   - Presenters often have impressive data on their charts, but fail to extract what data shows, so the audience doesn't understand what the numbers prove.Headings on charts should tell the audience how to think about numbers. 
   - Use headings to establish your main points. Guide the audience by numbering them on charts or slides, telling people how many you have.
4. Involve the audience.
5. Finish Strong
   - Close with a summary and a strong restatement of your proposition or recommendation. For major presentations, look for memorable, dramatic close.

**Sppeches that make a point**   
Most people have terrible time knowing where to begin in writing a speech. The answer is not to hunt for a great opening. Not to ask around for the latest joke. The place is to think about who is in your audience and decide what you want to say to them.   
Decide what single point you want them to take away. Then start writing. You can put down anything that gets you into what you want to talk about, no matter how clumsy it seems. There's time to polish it later. The point is to get rolling. 
Immerse yourself in your subject long before you write. Read about it, make notes of lines that might be used, illustrative stories, items in the news that bear upon it. All will help you settle on a theme. The next step is a broad outline, with three or four major points and examples or subpointsunder each. In writing a speech, it helps to think about addressing one individual rather than a faceless audience. Another tricks that often works : Cross out first several paragraphs. You will often find your opening line halfway down the first page.

1. Frame the subject/Title with a point of view: 
   - Your title shoudl reflkect your point of view. Ideas that you believe in make good speeches. Tom peters(search of excellence) advises not to accept any topic that you dont feel strongly about. An audience's biggest turn on is the speaker's obvious enthusiasm.  
2. Start fast
   - Start with that single point you want your audience to take away
3. Write your speech to be spoken: Think of it as conversation with a friend  
4. Leave them thinking
5. Making it sound easy:
   - The only way to do this is to *rehearse*. Rehearse what you have to say over and over until you know it almost by heart. The better you know your speech , the more spontaneous you will sound. And the more confident.Great presenters and speakers make it all sound so easy and so natural that one assumes it just pours out of them. IT ALMOST NEVER DOES.

### Chapter 7: Plans and reports that make things happen 
Tips:
- Build a foundation of facts from which you can draw conclusions
- State recommendations and reasons for the report clearly
- Give your report a structure: Purpose, summary, findings, conclusions, recommendations, next steps
- Separate opinion from facts   
Write with a specific person in mind. — Warren Buffet

your plan needs to have clear recommendations for next steps. Just consider the franchise plan described above; one recommendation drawn from this plan could be to “research six potentially profitable locations to build new stores.” This works because the next action, “research six locations” and the reason, “to build new stores,” are both crystal clear.

When it comes to reports, the approach is slightly different – and the structure can be as well. Specifically, the purpose of a report should be laid out in a clear, interesting fashion, right from the beginning. You could say, for instance, “this report analyzes the potential profitability for a franchise store in downtown Tokyo.”

The structure that follows this initial sentence can be flexible; it might begin with recommendations, followed by supporting evidence, or proceed in the opposite order. As long as the structure is logical, you have a lot of license here.

Just remember, graphs and tables should be saved for the end, included in an appendix.

### Chapter 8: Recommendations and Proposals that sell ideas
Making a persuasive case:
- Sell, don’t just present. Use logic and passion, anticipate audience reservations. Start with the title, which promises a benefit. Organize to persuade.
- Tell people where you’re going: subject and its scope. Remind people where you’re coming from.
- Lead people with headings.
- Recommend, and do it early. Emphasize benefits of the rec’s
- Show how your project meets their needs.
- Make it urgent.
- Don’t be dull.

No matter what your industry, at some point, you’ll have to use writing to sell your ideas. Your recommendations will need to be persuasive. But how?

Well, a good tip to start with is to cut to the chase; state what you want and offer your reasoning after the fact.

It’s as simple as introducing the topic and the nature of your recommendation in the first paragraph; doing so will give the reader a sense of where you’re headed.

Next, you should demonstrate your competence with background information. For instance, a consulting firm once convinced the board of the New York Botanical Garden to adopt a new environmental program by showcasing its past work. The firm outlined its prior visits to other botanical gardens and offered an astute financial analysis of the costs involved in the proposed project.

You should also be sure to highlight the benefits for the reader. You can do so by incorporating the benefits into a list of goals that correspond to the recommended action. As an example, you might lay out the goal of “achieving a suitable return on investment.”

If you follow the above steps, you should be able to convince people of your recommendation. But if you’re asking for funding, your approach will need to be a bit more specific.

In the first two paragraphs, you need to describe exactly how much money you’re asking for and how it will be spent, thereby demonstrating that you meet the funder’s criteria. From there, you can proceed with a logically structured argument, in which each point is backed up by evidence and transitions seamlessly into the next.

Build a sense of urgency and illustrate why the benefits of the project will be lost without funding.

Last, you’ll want to grab your reader’s attention. An effective option here is to employ a similar strategy as when adding a flourish to a presentation. For instance, you could open with a compelling description of a person whose life would be completely changed by the funding.

### Chapter 9:Asking for Money: Sales and Fund-Raising Letters
- Don’t assume anything — test! And be ready to be surprised.
- True value: customers have lifetime value.
- Something free, no matter how small, can add power to a sales letter — a free first copy, free membership certificate
- Test YOUR OFFER — not just little surface things like underlining or postscripts
- Start fast — in the first sentence. “Frankly, X is not for everyone.”
- Successful strategies start not with what to say, but to whom
- Say thanks, then please
- Make your appeal personal: people would rather give to other people than faceless institutions.
- Never exaggerate anything you offer.

### Chapter 10: Coping with Political Correctness
“Can speech ever be both correct and free?” —Joe Rogaly, headline of an Ethics Today article in the Financial Times
Be sensitive, but not oversensitive.

### Chapter 11 Writing a Resume — and Getting an Interview
Companies don’t hire resumes, but people. But a good resume helps.
Summarize what you have to offer, objectively. Keep it simple.
When writing a cover letter: think about the reader, what will you offer the prospective employer? Say what led you to apply. Pique the reader’s interest. Address an individual, not a job title.
Be specific, factual, personal, direct, natural. Propose a specific next step, not just “hope to hear from you soon” or “thank you for your consideration.”
Say “I’ll call you on Wed afternoon to see if you’d like me to come in for an interview.” Volunteer to call so they don’t have to go to the trouble.
Send different letters to different readers. Send lots of letters. Finding a job is partly a members game.
Follow up to an interview with a letter, comment on something specific.

### Chapter 12: Editing Yourself
Never send out the first draft of anything important…Nothing you write will be born smooth
Smoothness is achieved only by scraping off roughness — Oscar Hammerstein II
If it’s not essential, cut it out!
Final checklist:
- Are you mumbling?
- Have you got things in the best order?
- Are there holes in your argument?
- Are your facts right?
- Is your tone right?
- Did you let time elapse between drafts? Did you ask other people?

If you’ve been working on a piece for too long, your mistakes might start to fade into the background. To catch them, give yourself enough time between drafts, and have another person review your writing. Both of these steps will help reveal mistakes that previously went unnoticed.

**Two simple editing tips**   
- Let the time elapse between drafts 
- Solicit the opinion of other people   

Print the clean copy of your drafts.Set it aside. Get away from it atleast overnight. Then come back to it in the morning.
