This is the book that I am reading and it has some valuable lessons for writing in business world

We will write in bullet points

### Chapter 1 : Writing that works

1. A discipline for writing: putting down first what you want the readers to do, next the three most imp things the reader needs to understand to take that action, then starting to write. When you are done, read yourself and ask whether if you were the reader , would you take the action on the basis of whats written.  
2. You must express your point of view persuasively. 

### Chapter 2 : Dont mumble- and other principles of effective writing
1. Make organisation of writing clear: When you write anything longer than few paragraphs, start by telling the reader where you are going.  
First, you must know where you are going yourself. Make an outline of major points, placing supporting details in their proper position. End with a summary. Summary is not a conclusion. Your summary should introduce no new ideas, it should summarize the most important points you have made.   
2. Use short paragraphs, short sentences and short words
3. Use active voice and avoid vague adjective and adverb(vergy good-> great, basically -> vitally etc)
4. Be specific and come to the point
5. Strike out the words you dont need. (ex. advance plan -> plan,take action -> act, study in depth-> study)
6. keep in your mind what your reader doesnt know.
7. Write so that you cant be misunderstood. 
8. Use plain english even on technical subjects. 
   
### Chapter 3: I love my computer!
1. Write first, format later.
2. Cautions      
   - Proof-read and proofread again
   - spell checker program
   - stick to the point

### Chapter 4: E-mail
1. Make the subject heading clear -- and compelling(i.e Status of proposal or Winning client approval )
2. Cut to the point    
   - Try to take out 50% of what you have written
   - Keep it short and sweet is the first email principle at HBO
3. Set the right tone of voice
   - the subject heading can be good place to establish tone you want

Email rules by Electronic Art CEO for its employees   
1. Dont use email when a quick word over a cube wall will do the trick 
2. Dont send unless what you are sending 
   - imparts a new information to someone who needs it. or 
   - agrees to a request. or
   - respond to a question or 
   - ask a question or makes a request

### Chapter 5: Memos and letters that get things done  
1. Make your first sentence work hard 
2. Stop when you are through
3. Be specific about next step
4. Read Churchil's memo. 

### Chapter 6: Writing for an audience- Presentation and Speeches
The principal form of presentation in most orgs has become the "deck", jargon for page after page of bulletedpoints serving as a framework for spoken elaboration.  
Reducing the issue to "its pulsing essence" is what a well done deck does best. Only key points on each page, as few words as possible. But the points on page must point to something- some *action*.

The format carries the audience on a flow of logic:  
1. Objective 
2. Background
3. Facts
4. Conclusions
5. Recommendations
6. Next steps   
A useful model to help organise that analysis is the pyramid principle.
#### The Pyramid principle
The easiest order is to receive the major, more abstract ideas before the minor, supporting ones.And since the major ideas are always derived from minor ones, the ideal structure of the ideas will be always be a pyramid of group of ideas tied together by a single overall thought.   
Within that pyramid structure, the ideas will relate vertically- in that a point at any level will always be a summary of the ideas grouped below, and horizontally--in  that the ideas will have been grouped together because they present a logical arguement.   

**How to organise presentations**  
1. Keep things simple-- Keep them on target
2. Tell your audience where you are going
3. Think headlines, not labels
   - Presenters often have impressive data on their charts, but fail to extract what data shows, so the audience doesn't understand what the numbers prove.Headings on charts should tell the audience how to think about numbers. 
   - Use headings to establish your main points. Guide the audience by numbering them on charts or slides, telling people how many you have.
4. Involve the audience.
5. Finish Strong
   - Close with a summary and a strong restatement of your proposition or recommendation. For major presentations, look for memorable, dramatic close.

**Sppeches that make a point**   
Most people have terrible time knowing where to begin in writing a speech. The answer is not to hunt for a great opening. Not to ask around for the latest joke. The place is to think about who is in your audience and decide what you want to say to them.   
Decide what single point you want them to take away. Then start writing. You can put down anything that gets you into what you want to talk about, no matter how clumsy it seems. There's time to polish it later. The point is to get rolling. 
Immerse yourself in your subject long before you write. Read about it, make notes of lines that might be used, illustrative stories, items in the news that bear upon it. All will help you settle on a theme. The next step is a broad outline, with three or four major points and examples or subpointsunder each. In writing a speech, it helps to think about addressing one individual rather than a faceless audience. Another tricks that often works : Cross out first several paragraphs. You will often find your opening line halfway down the first page.

1. Frame the subject/Title with a point of view: 
   - Your title shoudl reflkect your point of view. Ideas that you believe in make good speeches. Tom peters(search of excellence) advises not to accept any topic that you dont feel strongly about. An audience's biggest turn on is the speaker's obvious enthusiasm.  
2. Start fast
   - Start with that single point you want your audience to take away
3. Write your speech to be spoken: Think of it as conversation with a friend  
4. Leave them thinking
5. Making it sound easy:
   - The only way to do this is to *rehearse*. Rehearse what you have to say over and over until you know it almost by heart. The better you know your speech , the more spontaneous you will sound. And the more confident.Great presenters and speakers make it all sound so easy and so natural that one assumes it just pours out of them. IT ALMOST NEVER DOES.
