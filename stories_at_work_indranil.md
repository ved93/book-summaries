## Intro
Importance of storytelling. He answeres trhe question how to remember the right story when you need it. Author emphasis on story bank system.
First, identify the key facts and critical elements of the story. Second, create tags for the subjects for which you may use the story. A great way to add the tags is to tell the story to few colleagues and ask what it meant to them. 

Author urges to make the effort and start storing the stories you read here and elsewhere.. This habit is important. 

## Part 1: foundation
### Stories are powerful

### How to build your story bank
five elements of a story:
1. Stories usually start with time marker or place marker
2. Stories are always about something happening - a causal sequence of events. 
   Good stories -> help you see whats happening.
   Great stories -> feel whats happening.
3. Contain people's names.
4. It isnt a story unless something unanticipated happens.
5. A relevance statement. Why am I telling this story? Whats the point I am making.

### Telling, Listening to and Triggering stories
four situations in business to start storytelling journey:
