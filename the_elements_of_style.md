There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground. Correct: Dead leaves covered the ground. (made lively by substituting verb in the active) 

Rule 11: Put statement in positive form:   
Make definite assertions. Use the word *not* as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a means of evasion.  
He was not very often on time. Correct: He usually came late

Rule 12: Use definite, specific, concrete language
